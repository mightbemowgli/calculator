# calculator

Here's the completed version of my simple calculator for **The Odin Project** created using
HTML, CSS, and JS. 

This was another good lesson in utilizing event handlers to modify the DOM. The basic calculation
functions were easy enough, but working through the actual algorithm to evaluate and operate
on the user input took some time. 

I would like to come back and try to add keyboard functionality in the near future.

In the mean time, here's a [working demo](https://mightbemowgli.github.io/calculator/).
